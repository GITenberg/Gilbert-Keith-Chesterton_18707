description: Maisie Ward's biography of Gilbert Keith Chesterton has long been a cornerstone
  in Chesterton studies, as well as in the publishing house she and her husband, Frank
  Sheed, founded in 1926. Originally published in 1942, just six years after Chesterton's
  untimely death, this book combines Ward's unique perspective as the author's friend
  and publisher with an examination of his personal correspondence and interviews
  with his closest friends and family. Here are Chesterton's childhood and school
  days, the friendship and foolery of youth, his early theological development, high
  spirited love letter.
